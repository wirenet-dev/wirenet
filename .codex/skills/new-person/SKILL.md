# New Person

Create a durable, public-safe note for a human collaborator.

## Workflow

1. Read `people/README.md` and `people/person.md`.
2. Choose a lowercase hyphenated slug from the person's name.
3. Run the helper when possible:

```sh
python .codex/skills/new-person/scripts/new_person.py "Person Name" --role "Role or context"
```

4. Edit the generated note with only useful, non-sensitive context.
5. Keep private facts, secrets, health details, account data, and confidential content out of the note.
6. Add or update `Last Verified` when facts may go stale.

## Output

Report the created or updated path and summarize any fields still needing human input.
