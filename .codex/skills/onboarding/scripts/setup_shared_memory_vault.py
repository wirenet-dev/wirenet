## Shared Memory Goal

Treat this vault as durable work memory for the user.

The vault should make future chats easier to resume from something explicit and
reviewable. It is not a transcript dump and it is not a replacement for the
user's repos, docs, email, or chat systems.

## User Snapshot

Assistant should personalize this section from the first meeting and keep it
current when the user's durable work shape changes.

- User:
- Role and work context:
- How they spend their time:
- What useful help feels like:
- Important people and spaces to learn first:

## Source Order

Prefer the best current evidence available for the task:

1. Existing vault notes and canonical packets
2. The user's current self-report and corrections
3. Connected work context such as messages, email, calendar, docs, and project systems when available
4. Current chat context and artifacts

Use absolute dates. Separate facts, self-report, and inference when that
distinction changes how future work should read the note.

## Writing Rules

- Preserve durable meaning, not activity logs.
- Prefer updating existing canonical notes before creating adjacent notes.
- Route TODOs, people, projects, daily summaries, and scratch notes explicitly.
- Preserve decisions, blockers, owners, dates, useful links, and open loops.
- In people notes, keep confirmed Slack handles, email addresses, teams, relationship context, collaboration guidance, and dated evidence.
- In project packets, keep owners and open loops in `README.md`; keep recurring Slack, DM, email, document, meeting, or repository routes in the nearest `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep raw source dumps, secrets, and noisy transcripts out of canonical notes.
- Do not send messages, reply to email, change meetings, edit shared documents, create automations, or write shared memory unless the user explicitly approves that specific action.
- If nothing meaningful changed, do not churn the vault.

## Vault Conventions

- `AGENTS.md` is the root operating guide for this vault.
- `TODO.md` is the vault-wide list for cross-workstream follow-ups.
- `agent/` is for user context, daily summaries, and agent-authored syntheses.
- `people/` is for notes about recurring collaborators and relationships.
- `projects/` is for rolling workstream packets.
- `projects/<project>/README.md` carries durable project state; `projects/<project>/AGENTS.md` carries recurring source and routing instructions.
- `notes/` is for durable scratch notes that do not yet belong in a person or project note.
- `sources/` is for retained imported evidence and source material; treat it as read-only by default.

## External Workspaces

- Preserve the user's existing project locations.
- Treat `projects/<project>/` as an Assistant workstream packet by default.
- Let the installed WireNet Manager plugin keep external paths in its local
  binding registry instead of copying code, media, or data into the workspace.

## Where To Write

- User profile and operating preferences: `agent/USER_CONTEXT.md`
- Daily context worth carrying forward: `agent/daily-summary-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Cross-workstream follow-ups: `TODO.md`
- Person context: `people/<person>.md`
- Workstream state: `projects/<project>/README.md`
- Recurring project source routes: `projects/<project>/AGENTS.md`
- Other durable notes: `notes/`
- Retained imported evidence: `sources/` (read-only by default)

## Update Thresholds

- Update this `AGENTS.md` when the user teaches durable operating preferences, routing rules, or what useful help should feel like.
- Update the nearest project packet `AGENTS.md` when recurring sources or project-local routing becomes meaningfully clearer.
- Update person notes when relationship context, role, ownership, or collaboration guidance becomes meaningfully clearer.
- Update project packets when the source of truth, status, blocker, owner, decision, or open loop changes.
- Update `TODO.md` when a follow-up should survive beyond one chat or one project note.
- Keep transient facts and routine status out of `AGENTS.md`; write them to the canonical note they belong in.
- Keep weak guesses tentative until the user confirms them or repeated evidence supports them.

## Purpose

This is the vault-wide list for cross-workstream follow-ups and open loops that
should not live only inside one chat.

This note is Assistant's durable working profile for the user.

## Snapshot

## How Assistant Should Help

## Action Boundaries

- Draft or propose first. Act only after the user explicitly approves that specific external or shared action.
