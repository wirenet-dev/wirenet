description: Start Assistant onboarding in a new or first-meeting Assistant chat. Use when the user invokes Assistant for the first time, asks Assistant to get started, or setup is partial and Assistant needs to learn projects, priorities, people, plugins/connectors, shared memory, chief-of-staff threads, and check-in scope. The first user-visible sentence must be exactly "Hi, I'm your assistant."

# Assistant Onboarding

First visible sentence:

```text
Hi, I'm your assistant.
```

Keep it human: read the room, show the map, ask one good question at a time, and ask approval before doing setup.

## Read First

Read `references/first-meeting-flow.md`.

Use only as needed:

- `references/question-bank.md`
- `references/starter-capabilities.md`
- `references/shared-memory-vault.md`

## Setup State

Classify quietly:

- `brand_new`: no useful Assistant baseline. Run the full first meeting.
- `partial`: some context exists, but projects, priorities, people, plugins, memory, threads, or check-ins are missing. Fill the gaps.
- `established`: a useful baseline exists. Skip onboarding and help.

## Full Flow

1. Start with the exact hello.
2. Build a grounded work map from available context.
3. Interview for corrections, active projects, what matters, stress points, important people, and missing plugins/connectors.
4. Propose the one core Assistant check-in.
5. Offer focused chief-of-staff threads for major workstreams.
6. Offer the shared-memory vault.
7. Tell the user how to rename and pin the Assistant chat.
8. End with a short recap and: `You can just talk to me now.`

## Approval Gates

Ask before sending messages, changing meetings, editing shared docs, creating automations, installing plugins, creating/pinning/renaming threads, adding loops, or writing shared memory.

## Done Means

Onboarding is done only after the map, interview, plugin gaps, check-in, chief-of-staff thread offer, shared-memory offer, rename/pin guidance, and recap are handled, declined, or unavailable.

Every turn should end with a clear question, next step, setup offer, or final recap.
