# New Project

Create a project or experiment that agents can discover later.

## Workflow

1. Read root `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`.
2. Decide whether the work is a long-lived `project` or short-lived `experiment`.
3. Use a lowercase hyphenated slug. Experiments must use `exp-<topic>-YYYY-MM-DD`.
4. Run the helper when possible:

```sh
python .codex/skills/new-project/scripts/new_project.py "Project Name" --summary "One-line summary"
```

For an experiment:

```sh
python .codex/skills/new-project/scripts/new_project.py "Experiment Name" --type experiment --summary "One-line summary"
```

5. Add project-specific commands, data sources, and safety gates to the generated `AGENTS.md` if they matter.
## Output

Report the created folder and any missing fields that need human input.
